If you're looking for the code for this, it's located in the gcpNetwork folder
I had to set it up to follow a maven project structure

TO ACTUALLY RUN THE APP IN DOCKER:
Reference website for using Xming:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jamiedalton/windows-10-docker-gui

Add your IPV4 address to the x0.hosts file
Make sure Docker is running
Make sure Xming is running 

You need to set up the IP Address like so:
set-variable -name DISPLAY -value <IPV4_address>:0.0
Replace the <IPV4_address> with your actual IPV4 address

Then build the image with
docker build -t my-java-app .

Then to launch the image, run:
docker run -it --privileged -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix my-java-app
